INSTRUCTIONS PLEASE READ

- this game is like super smash, there are
no hp bars
- instead, the more damage you have, the more knockback
you take, the goal of the game is to knock the player out of the map
- top right corner has a damage indicator (the redder it is, the higher
damage you have)
- knockback also depend on the specific attack (each direction
have a different attack)


once you press an attack key, circular hurtboxes will pop out
there is first a loading time, indicated by a gray circle,
where the weapon can't deal damage. Following that is a red circle,
where the weapon can deal damage. Then it's another gray circle for
recovery time.

you get three jumps, one light up recovery, and one heavy recovery
you can jump off walls (jumps reset)

you can throw the gadgets and weapons and you are able to pick them back up
if they haven't disappeared yet

for weapons (only has a hammar for now), picking them up automatically
switches to use them instead of fists (attack keys are the same)

for gadgets, you can use them by pressing the 'J' key, gadget spawned 
things can damage both players and your gadget is gone once you use them


there are currently no sprites/animation
