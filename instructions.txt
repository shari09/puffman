INSTRUCTIONS PLEASE READ

Type 'jall Gameloop.java' in the terminal to compile and run

- this game is like super smash, there are
no hp bars
- instead, the more damage you have, the more knockback
you take, the goal of the game is to knock the player out of the map
- knockback also depend on the specific attack (each direction
have a different attack)

- your damage is currently being printed in the 
terminal for now


once you press an attack key, circular hurtboxes will pop out
there is first a loading time, indicated by a gray circle,
where the weapon can't deal damage. Following that is a red circle,
where the weapon can deal damage. Then it's another gray circle for
recovery time.

you get three jumps, one light up recovery, and one heavy recovery
you can jump off walls (jumps reset)



there are currently no sprites/animation
